# Operation System Course: Kosaraju Assignment
This repository contains the soultion for Kosaraju Assignment in Operation System Course.


## Description
In our Operating Systems assignment, we explored the implementation of multi-client communication using diverse paradigms such as Reactor, Proactor, Select, Poll, and referenced Beej's Chat for practical illustration. This exercise focused on understanding and implementing efficient socket programming techniques to manage simultaneous client connections. By comparing and contrasting these paradigms, we aimed to enhance our grasp of asynchronous I/O and event-driven architectures, essential for developing scalable and robust network applications in real-world scenarios.
